This is my personal blog where I write about anything that I want to. I am completely unqualified to write about some of these topics, so please take all my posts with a grain of salt.

## About the Author
I'm a high school student from South Korea planning to study physics abroad. My areas of interest within physics are mathematical physics and philosophy of physics, but I am also interested in topics like education, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and epistemology. 

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me via my email: **wonseunghyun248@gmail.com**.
